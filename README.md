## Summary

This repository contains the research paper and associated materials for:

**Comparative Sentiment Analysis of Public Perception During Health Crises: COVID-19 vs. Monkeypox Using Advanced Machine Learning**

Presented at the **3rd International Conference on Big Data, IoT and Machine Learning (BIM 2025)**, Dhaka International University, Bangladesh (September 25–27, 2025).

### Abstract

This study conducts a comparative sentiment analysis of public perception during COVID-19 and Monkeypox health crises using advanced machine learning techniques. We employed transformer models (XLNet and DistilRoBERTa) to analyze crisis-related Twitter data, demonstrating their superior performance over traditional ML models. The research uniquely combines sentiment analysis results with epidemiological metrics (Case Fatality Rate and Population Attributable Fraction) to provide novel insights into public fear, trust patterns, and misinformation spread during pandemics.

Our findings contribute to understanding how different health crises impact public discourse and can inform more effective crisis communication strategies for future public health emergencies.
